There are two ways found to work around Network

-   The Microsoft .NET Framework provides a layered, extensible, and
    managed implementation of Internet services that can be quickly and
    easily integrated into your applications. Your network applications
    can build on pluggable protocols to automatically take advantage of
    new Internet protocols

-   You can use a managed implementation of the Windows socket interface
    to work with the network on the socket level.
