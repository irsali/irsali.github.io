Ensuring Intellisense in Visual Studio 2017 for css
===================================================

While working on frameworks like Angular or Aurelia, where we install
dependencies using npm, bower. The dependency css files are not part of
project or the way these files are part of the project(minified,
excluded). Visual Studio is unable to provide intellisense.

Just add the non-minified css file in project, you will see intellisense
back in your project.
