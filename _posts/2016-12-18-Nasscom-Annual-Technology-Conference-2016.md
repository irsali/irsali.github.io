It was a great oppurtunity provided by my company `Brain Technosys Pvt. Ltd.`.  The workshop was organized by `Nasscom` in `GlobalLogic Inc.` Greater Noida on 13 Dec, 2016. 

I just wanted to point out that every software Engineer should attend these kind of workshop. It was the first time, i was going to attend a technical workshop outside my office. I was hoping to learn new ideas and approaches to make me more effective and efficient at work. And of course learning in a space. It was quite more than that.

We are currently developing applications using Monolithic and Services Oriented Architecture. The workshop was about the latest Architecture for developing applications that can be scaled to serve billion of users simultaneouly. Microservices architecture is a new software architecture paradigm which is helping the organizations to enable scalable & agile business, have faster feature launch/time to market and flexibility. The workshop has provided me foundational knowledge on Microservices architecture, their applicability and best practices.

During development, i found myself automating repeated tasks or making them one click done. This was the begining for me to adopt new style of development where team size can be bigger than i have worked so far with faster release cycles.  Working on Microservices is start with aquiring a new culture of development. Services interacting with each other are platform and language independent. Making deployment process at development/staging/Published server should be same. Orchestration of Services and specialization of services is something that makes it different that SOA. And Ofcourse, this is the challenge with Microservices. One of the most difficult challenge working with Microservices is handling transaction across Microservices. There were several take aways.

I hope, i would get the chance of working on Microservices very soon.

Happy coding!
