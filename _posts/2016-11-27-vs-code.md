VS Code, full name is Visual Studio Code. I can say, it is going to be my second favourite code editor. I mainly use Visual Studio IDE for development. But when it comes to development completly using node.js, javascript/typescript, angular. I prefer VS Code these days. It has a good intellisense suppport with debugging and git version control. A lot of language support and features can be added from VS Code extensions. I found this Starter video quite helpful. If you are a starter for VS Code, I suggest watch it.

## Outline
- [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install VS Code.

Also, i suugest going through with basics can help you a lot. 

[VS Code Basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics)

[Key boaard Shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings) and you can modify the VS Code shortcuts to match those of other editors so you don't need to learn new keyboard shortcuts.

- Find customization options in user and workspace settings.
- Change and learn key bindings.
- Write code faster with snippets, including creating your own.

There are lots of tutorials out there for advance learning, but i feel like above are good enough to get me started with the VS Code.

Happy Coding.
