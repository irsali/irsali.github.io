# Modernizing My Website: From Jekyll to Svelte — Powered by AI

For years, my personal profile and blog website stayed on my to-rewrite list. Like most side projects, time was the main blocker. But with the rapid evolution of AI tools, I finally decided to take the plunge and rebuild it — this time letting AI be my co-developer.

## Why Migrate?

My old site was built with **Jekyll**, hosted on GitHub Pages. It was fast and simple, but I wanted:
- ⚡ Better performance
- 💬 More interactivity
- 🔧 Easier maintainability
- 🎯 A modern development stack

After weighing options like React and Angular, I picked **Svelte** — specifically SvelteKit — for its refreshingly minimal approach:
- **No virtual DOM**  
- **Tiny bundle sizes**  
- **Closer to native HTML, CSS, and JS**  

As Svelte says: *“Disappears at compile time.”*

## The Setup

I started by:
1. Generating a new SvelteKit project via CLI.
2. Keeping both the **Jekyll** and **SvelteKit** projects in a single workspace so GitHub Copilot could reference both for the migration.
3. Creating a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to guide Copilot on my goals, preferences, and migration strategy.

The old site had no backend — just static HTML, CSS, and JS — and the new one would follow the same principle. Blog search on the Jekyll site was powered by `search.js` and metadata generated at build time. My new site now has a **Svelte-friendly, client-side search** that works similarly.

## AI in the Driver’s Seat

I leaned heavily on **GitHub Copilot**:
- Copilot generated my blog website **completely** without me writing a single line of code manually.
- Svelte 5 being relatively new caused a few configuration issues — which meant I had to learn a bit of Svelte to tweak and fix things.
- For the personal profile section, I switched to **Cursor**, and it delivered exactly what I needed.

## Human Collaboration

For one final touch, I wanted a link to my old website on the new one — but with some artistic flair. I delegated this to **[Nasre Alam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nasrealam1/)**, and he nailed it beautifully.

## The Result

Now, my modernized **SvelteKit-powered website** is live — faster, more interactive, and future-friendly, with the all of the features of my original blog still intact.  
This wasn’t just a migration — it was an experiment in **AI-assisted development**, and the results have been nothing short of inspiring.

💡 *Takeaway:* With the right mix of AI tools and human creativity, side projects don’t have to stay on the back burner.
